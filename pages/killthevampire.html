    <p>
      "Kill the Vampire" is a short game where the player must overcome three challenges to slay the vampire
      and save the town. First, they must adventure through the castle, using both near and far range combat to
      beat monsters. Then, they'll be chased through a winding maze, using beacons to distract the
      vampire and get away when in need of an escape. Finally, they'll end up in the castle's dungeon,
      where they'll solve a series of puzzles to trap the vampire once and for all.

    <h2><b>✰ my specific contributions</b></h2>
    <p> I worked on the mechanics and level design for the first part of the game's puzzle segment.
      This includes implementing the repel/attraction of crates via player shooting, utilizing Unity raycasts
      to program the laser and its reflection behavior, etc. I also modeled 3D assets (crates, laser shooter and receptor)
      within Maya, and hand-drew some of the 2D textures.
