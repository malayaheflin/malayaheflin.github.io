      Anodyne is a virtual reality experience that places the user onboard a dystopian ship long after
      the destruction of Earth. Now homesick for their roots, the remaining population has immersed
      themselves in their own virtual realities to recreate what they lost. The user is free to roam around
      the spaceship, and can reach towards a person to see what they're experiencing in their VR headset.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anodyne" was publicly exhibited as part of the Immersive Media Design Spring Showcase from May 3 - 5, 2023.

    <h2><b>✰ my specific contributions</b></h2>
    <p>I took the lead on the nature scene, in which the player wanders the trail of a park.
      To follow along with the narrative of seeing through another person's eyes, we wanted the player
      to automatically move along the path, which required disabling their usual movement control (while retaining
      the movement of the head) and attatching the player along a Bezier curve. In addition to this, I did some minor
      C# scripting to implement time and movement-triggered scene changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for art, I made a couple of models and animations in Maya (ex: satellite spinning outside of spaceship)
      as well as 2D textures (ex: newspaper story). I also drew a few scenes for our team storyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, my entire team and I designed a small exhibition space to present our project at the Immersive
      Media Design Spring Showcase. We used a small tent and tarps to further isolate the user, then projected
      the user's view onto one wall so that any friends and family could experience it along with them. We also
      added some star lights to enhance the spaceship theme, and finally designed and displayed a poster to summarize
      and explain our experience.
