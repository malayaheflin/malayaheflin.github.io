        ​This was my first virtual reality project! Created in collaboration with 
        three of my peers, it commemorates the creation of Donald Duck by putting
        the viewer right in the middle of his premiere short, "The Wise Little Hen."
        I learned so much from this project, including how to use sprite animation 
        and audio within Unity to tell a story, how to perform testing with an Oculus Quest 2 headset,
        and how to maintain communication when working with a team.

    <h2><b>✰ my specific contributions</b></h2>
    <p>
      For this project, I took the lead of configuring the scene inside Unity. This includes
      placing all art assets and creating/timing their animation using Unity's built-in sprite animation tools.
      I also drew some of the 2D art assets, including the hen's house, the hen & chicks, and the corn stalks.
