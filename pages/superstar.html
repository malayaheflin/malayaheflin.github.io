      An immersive, "escape-room" experience based primarly on augmented reality interactions. There are 3 sections, each themed around different musical
       genres: jazz, EDM, and pop. Players travel through each room, solving clues by using
       a tablet and other technology to interact with their physical environments, helping them earn an instrument from each section.
       This culminates in a final projection-mapped display where players can see the instruments they've collected
       along with their winning trophy.

      "superstAR" was developed as part of the Immersive Media Design New Works Incubator at the 
      University of Maryland, College Park. It was publicly exhibited on September 7 and 8 at the 
      <a href="https://theclarice.umd.edu/nnf" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-opacity">
        <u>2023 NextNow Fest</u></a>, an annual on-campus arts festival.

    <h2><b>✰ my contributions</b></h2>

    <h4>Technology</h4>
    <p>I implemented all technological elements used to make superstAR, developing the following features:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>creating the tablet interactivity and <b>interface within the Unity</b> game engine</li>
        <li>writing all <b>C# scripts</b>, including AR image tracking and recognition</li>
        <li>using an <b>Adafruit Circuit Playground with Arduino code</b> to take in and adjust sound
          input values, which is then used in conjunction with a C# script to produce
          resulting output in Unity </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Art</h4>
    <p>I created the following art assets: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>superstAR logo and animation</li>
      <li>EDM character</li>
      <li>misc. elements (ex: music note frame)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Other</h4>
    <p>As a group, we all helped out with the following tasks: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>arranging props and lighting to make each section more immersive</li>
      <li>designing and implenting the finale projection-mapped display using MadMapper</li>
      <li>practicing project management to distribute tasks and create a deadline sheet</li>
      <li>creating planning documents, including concept art and initial sketches</li>
    </ul>
