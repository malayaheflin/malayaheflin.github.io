        "superstAR" was developed as part of the Immersive Media Design New Works Incubator at the University of Maryland, College Park. It was chosen by judges to be publicly exhibited on September 7 and 8 at the 2023 NextNow Fest, an annual on-campus arts festival, where it was experienced by 100+ participants.<br>
        It is an immersive, "escape-room" experience based primarily on augmented reality interactions. There are 3 sections, each themed around different musical genres: jazz, EDM, and pop. Players travel through each room, solving clues by using a tablet and other technology to interact with their physical environments, helping them earn an instrument from each section. This culminates in a final projection-mapped display where players can see the instruments they've collected along with their winning trophy.

      <text>
        I led all technological elements used to make superstAR, developing the following features:
        <ul>
          <li>Implement AR image tracking and recognition</li>
          <li>Implement general game functionality</li>
          <li>Design and implement UI</li>
          <li>Process sound input with Adafruit Circuit Playground & Arduino code, which is then used in conjunction with a C# script to produce resulting output in Unity </li>
        </ul>
        I also created the following art assets:
        <ul>
          <li>superstAR logo and animation</li>
          <li>EDM character</li>
          <li>Misc. elements (ex: music note frame)</li>
        </ul>

      <text class="descrip-title">Team Contributions</text>
      <text>
        <ul>
          <li>Use game design skills to ideate various clues and puzzles</li>
          <li>Design and implent the finale projection-mapped display using MadMapper</li>
          <li>Arrange props and lighting to make each section more immersive</li>
          <li>Create planning documents, including concept art, initial sketches, project timeline, and task distrubtion</li>
          <li>Playtest and present progress regularly to incubator team</li>
          <li>Facilitate two-day showcase at arts festival</li>
        </ul>
