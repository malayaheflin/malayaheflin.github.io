    <p>
      "Earthkeeper" is an immersive projection art installation that invites users to step into the role of a nature god. By utilizing motion tracking technology and software,
      we will allow users to manipulate the endangered environment projected before them. Through their touch and motion, they will temporarily transition the dark and dreary scenes, like dead forests, animal ghosts, and still waters, into the vibrant places they once were, until the magic fades.
      <br><br>
      Using projection, wherever a person puts their hands, greenery will “sprout” outwards from where the hand was placed. The greenery will continue to grow as long as the hand stays still, but as soon as the hand is picked up, the plants will “die,” or crumble and disappear.
      If a certain percentage of the environment is regrown, the next interaction will spark a fire that will burn everything down and reset the experience, showing
      the infinite cycle of death and regrowth. The focus is to create a simple concept interactive projection that leaves a lasting impression.
