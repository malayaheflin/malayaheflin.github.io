    <p>
        ​This is a short game in which users try to escape a randomly-generated maze by
        finding three randomly-placed keys: red, blue, and green. The player uses the
        colors they see to guide them to each key (for example, the closer the player is
        to the red key, the higher their vision's red color value will be). This game was
        developed within a team- my specific contributions were implementing the UI for
        the starting menu, as well as coding the scripts for the color change in relation
        to player location via post-processing effects.

    <h2><b>✰ my specific contributions</b></h2>
    <p>My role was to implement the main game mechanic, which is the color change of the user's surroundings.
      To do this, I wrote a C# script that figures out the user's position in relation to all three keys,
      then uses its distance to adjust each color value (red, green, and blue) from 0-255. Then, I used Unity's
      post-processing effects to apply these color changes to the user's field of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also designed the short title/instructions displayed before the game starts. I created this
      using Unity's UI toolkit.
